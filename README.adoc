= Format of a deck file:

it's a sequence of cards.
each card has two or more sides called x, y and z in the examples.

.three possible syntaxes:
* oneliner:
....
    : x / y / z
....
  
* multiline:
....
    * x
    x
    / y
    y
    / z
    z
....
  
* multi-oneliner:
....
    = x
    y
    z
....

* any empty lines at the beginning or end of a side will be trimmed
* the whitespace at the start of each line is conserved, and any syntax character {=,:,/,*}
recognized as such is replaced by a space to keep alignment
