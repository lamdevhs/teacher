v0.1.1.0 -- working version

* added margin in TUI to isolate command names and content
* replaced Card = [String] by \[[String]], and QandA by ([String], [String]),
  to keep each line isolated so the margin can be appended easily at the start of each
* replaced GiveAnswer by GiveAns, and "[Unrecognized]" by "Unknown", to have a smaller margin
* added missing filter of empty lines on start/end of sides of multi(one)line cards

v0.1.2.0 -- working version
* added binary pattern, based on a two side card whose first line is the whole first
  face, and the second side is the other lines:
....
    @ x
      y
      y
....
* fixed noEmptyLines to include whitespace-filled lines as well
