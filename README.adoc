= Format of a deck file:

it's a sequence of cards.
each card has two or more sides called x, y and z in the examples.

.possible syntaxes:
* oneliner:
....
    : x / y / z
....
  
* multiline:
....
    * x
      x
    / y
      y
    / z
      z
....
  
* multi-oneliner:
....
    = x
      y
      z
....

* binary: (two sides only, the first is a oneliner)
....
    @ x
      y
      y
....

* any empty / white lines at the beginning or end of a side will be trimmed
* the whitespace at the start of each line is conserved, and any syntax character {=,:,/,*}
recognized as such is replaced by a space to keep alignment
